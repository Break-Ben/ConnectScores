# Connect Scores
Scripts that improve Connect's assessment outlines page.  
Copy and paste them into the devtools console on [the assessment outlines page](https://connect.det.wa.edu.au/group/students/ui/my-settings/assessment-outlines) _(ctrl+shift+i or cmd+option+i)_

Note that these scripts run completely client-side, meaning they only access data that is already sent to your device.

## Scripts
**[Chart](../main/Chart.js):** Creates new charts that automatically combine all tests from a class into one. Also adds features like tooltips and exporting to images

**[Backup](../main/Backup.js):** Saves all data from all subjects into a single JSON file

**[Tooltip](../main/Tooltip.js):** Adds a tooltip to current charts _(deprecated)_

**[Table](../main/Table.js):** Lists scores in a table _(deprecated)_

**[Text](../main/Text.js):** Lists scores as text which is good for copy+pasting _(deprecated)_
